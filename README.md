# GATEWAY API FOR A SOCIAL MEDIA WEB APP

Simple Feed is a social media web app developed for an academic project, where I showcase a use case of using distributed databases while externalizing a basic content management service. This gateway-api handles all client-made requests, ensures user management and Auth, and redirects content management requests into an externalized microservice.
